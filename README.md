# ✈️ From Flight Deck to Python Deck: 100 Days of Code

Welcome aboard my turbulence-filled journey through Dr. Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp — where a full-time pilot by day tries to become a full-stack wizard by night.

This repo is my coding co-pilot, black box, and logbook — tracking every step (and stall) as I turn caffeine into code, and sky hours into screen hours.

## 🧭 What's in the Cargo?

- 🛫 Python fundamentals, with flair and a few unexpected turns
- 🎮 Logic games, creative mini-projects, and a suspicious number of Blackjack hands
- 🖥️ GUIs, APIs, automation scripts—because I can’t autopilot this
- 💾 Code that’s practical, playful, and just messy enough to prove I’m learning

## 🎯 Mission Briefing

Why am I doing this?

Because after flying 22 days a month, I needed a side quest that didn’t involve jet fuel or hotel breakfast buffets.
Because I miss solving real problems with real focus (and fewer delays).
Because I want a future where I work remotely, live flexibly, and still feel like I’m going somewhere—even if it’s just to the terminal window.

## 📂 Repo Format

- 'DayXX/' folders with scripts, notes, and caffeine stains
- Straightforward naming and clear comments—because clarity > cleverness
- Runs best on Python 3 and post-midnight determination ☕

## 👨‍✈️ About Me

Hi, I’m Sid! A pilot currently flying A330s, but quietly plotting a smooth descent into tech.
I love blending logic with meaning—whether it’s simulating card games, automating tedious tasks, or exploring Tarot through code.
I don’t just want to write code—I want to build a life with it.
