# 🎯 100 Days of Python Projects

Welcome to my wild ride through Dr. Angela Yu’s legendary _100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp_!  
This repo is my playground, my workshop, and my personal growth tracker—all rolled into one. Every project here is a step forward in turning logic into magic and code into creation.

## 🎮 What’s Inside?

- 🔍 Explorations in Python fundamentals (with flair!)
- 🕹️ Game challenges that test logic and creativity (yes, including Blackjack!)
- 💡 GUI apps, automation scripts, APIs—you name it!
- ✨ Code that’s clean, clever, and sometimes chaotic (but always fun)

## 📌 Why I Made This

Because learning should feel like leveling up in the best video game you've ever played.  
Because every day with Python sparks new ideas, new bugs 😅, and new ways to think.  
Because nothing beats the satisfaction of seeing your code _actually_ do the thing!

## 📁 Structure

- `DayXX/` folders with code, README, and assets  
- Clear naming, helpful comments, and bite-sized projects  
- Built with love, coffee, and a sprinkle of curiosity ☕

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m Sid! 🐍✨  
I like building stuff that blends logic with elegance. Whether it’s simulating financial systems, coding up card games, or diving into symbolic worlds like Tarot, I’m here for the challenge, the creativity, and the learning.
